### Explanation:

- **Class-level Javadoc (`Dowhileloop` class)**: Describes the purpose of the class (demonstrating a `do-while` loop).
- **Method-level Javadoc (`main` method)**: Explains the behavior of the `do-while` loop and the structure of the program.
- **Inline comments**: Provides step-by-step explanations, such as the initialization of the variable and how the loop executes once before checking the condition.
