public class Operator {

	// = Assignment operator

	/**
	 * Assignment operator (`=`) is used to assign the value of the right-hand
	 * operand to the left-hand operand. For example:
	 * 
	 * <pre>
	 * int x = 10; // assigns the value 10 to variable x
	 * </pre>
	 */

	// == Equal operator

	/**
	 * Equality operator (`==`) checks if two operands are equal. It returns `true`
	 * if they are equal, otherwise `false`. For example:
	 * 
	 * <pre>
	 * if (x == 10) {
	 * 	// code to execute if x is equal to 10
	 * }
	 * </pre>
	 */

	// != Not Equal operator

	/**
	 * Not equal operator (`!=`) checks if two operands are not equal. It returns
	 * `true` if they are not equal, otherwise `false`. For example:
	 * 
	 * <pre>
	 * if (x != 5) {
	 * 	// code to execute if x is not equal to 5
	 * }
	 * </pre>
	 */

	// > Greater Than operator

	/**
	 * Greater than operator (`>`) checks if the left operand is greater than the
	 * right operand. It returns `true` if the condition is met. For example:
	 * 
	 * <pre>
	 * if (x > 5) {
	 * 	// code to execute if x is greater than 5
	 * }
	 * </pre>
	 */

	// < Less Than operator

	/**
	 * Less than operator (`<`) checks if the left operand is less than the right
	 * operand. It returns `true` if the condition is met. For example:
	 * 
	 * <pre>
	 * if (x < 10) {
	 * 	// code to execute if x is less than 10
	 * }
	 * </pre>
	 */

	// <= Less Than or Equal operator

	/**
	 * Less than or equal to operator (`<=`) checks if the left operand is less than
	 * or equal to the right operand. It returns `true` if the condition is met. For
	 * example:
	 * 
	 * <pre>
	 * if (x <= 10) {
	 * 	// code to execute if x is less than or equal to 10
	 * }
	 * </pre>
	 */

	// >= Greater Than or Equal operator

	/**
	 * Greater than or equal to operator (`>=`) checks if the left operand is
	 * greater than or equal to the right operand. It returns `true` if the
	 * condition is met. For example:
	 * 
	 * <pre>
	 * if (x >= 5) {
	 * 	// code to execute if x is greater than or equal to 5
	 * }
	 * </pre>
	 */

	// && And operator

	/**
	 * Logical AND operator (`&&`) returns `true` if both operands are `true`. It is
	 * commonly used in conditional expressions. For example:
	 * 
	 * <pre>
	 * if (x > 5 && x < 10) {
	 * 	// code to execute if both conditions are true
	 * }
	 * </pre>
	 */

	// || Or operator

	/**
	 * Logical OR operator (`||`) returns `true` if at least one of the operands is
	 * `true`. It is commonly used in conditional expressions. For example:
	 * 
	 * <pre>
	 * if (x > 5 || x < 3) {
	 * 	// code to execute if either condition is true
	 * }
	 * </pre>
	 */
