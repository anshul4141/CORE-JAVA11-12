### Explanation:

- **Class-level Javadoc (`Add` class)**: Provides an overview of the class, explaining its purpose (demonstrating basic addition).
- **Method-level Javadoc (`main` method)**: Describes the purpose of the `main` method, noting that it's the entry point for the program and explaining its functionality.
- **Inline comments**: Each step of the code has comments to explain what is being done, like variable declaration, assignment, and the addition operation.
